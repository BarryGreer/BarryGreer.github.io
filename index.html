									<h2>Intrest in IT</h2>
								</header>
								<ul class="features">
								<p>At first my interest in IT was being apart of a game development team coming up with designs
								and improvements to games, but now I’m just interested in being apart of a software development
								team and I like all aspects of the process such as designing, development or evaluating or updating.
								My interest in IT started when I first started to find conversations online discussing their opinions
								on video games and how they could be improved, so I chose IT electives in high school and that
								broadened my view on the options for employment and a range of expertise you can have.
								They main reason I was influenced to do project base work was by a student teacher at
								my high school who was a consultant for government agencies developing systems and interfaces for them.</p>
								
								
								<p>I chose to come to RMIT because all my IT classmates in high school agreed that RMIT was the
								best choice for learning more IT skills and is more respected by employers and has a good reputation.</p>
								
								<p>I expect to learn how to program at more experienced levels as well as broaden my skills in 
								different sections of IT, so I have a variety of experience and a collective understanding of the IT world.</p>

									<h3>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</h3>
									
									<p>I can be very closed off at times and can be very quiet, but I like to 
									take things serious when in working situations and make sure I’m understanding
									everyone’s points of views in order to not let others down. I do like to consider
									all options and information to make more concise decisions rather then just 
									'trust my gut’. When it comes to stressful situations, I try to stay relaxed and
									focused, but I can become anxious if they don’t get easier fast, such as long projects
									that aren’t handled in a timely fashion.</p>
									
									<h3>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h3>
									
									<p>When in a team scenario I try to make sure everyone has a voice as I try
									to make sure everyone is involved and if the team struggles to cooperate,
									I normally try to play a leader role, otherwise I normally am quieter and
									keep to myself and make sure I’m doing my part.</p>
									
									<h3>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h3>
									
									<p>I should make sure when I’m making a team that I get everyone
									to participate in discussions as I learn better by hearing as
									I’m an auditory learner, also as I make decisions by understanding
									the whole situation. </p>

						<!-- Project Idea -->
							<section id="project_idea" class="main special">
								<header class="major">
									<h2>Project Idea</h2>
								</header>
								
								<p>My project idea would be an application most likely for a phone that would 
								track user customised or featured events and create a form of a checklist on 
								what the user would need for the event including specific items such as a computer
								or passport, what type of clothes as well as quantity of them. The app would also
								organise the time of the trip and what estimated time to leave to make sure the
								user is on time or early. The user will be reminded when to leave what to make
								sure they have by notifications from the app.</p>
								
								<p>This project is motivated by my own experience as well as observations of 
								others forgetfulness, so I thought it would be useful to have your own checklist
								that you could go through before leaving for the day to go to school, work or a 
								night out with friends. Sometimes one little reminder to bring a piece of work or
								a device charger from a friend or family member can be what changes a stressful
								day at work or school to a productive one.</p>
								
								<p>The event planner application would ask you to select some common or future
								events from a list that can be edited, or custom events can be inputted.
								The selection process would include clarifying specific details about the event
								such as the date of the event what time it would be at and how long it would occur.
								Other required details would be what attire or dress code that is needed such as
								causal, dress up or formal. Items that would be taken for the event or trip to the
								event would also be recorded from the user, they would also be able to highlight
								items as important so that the application makes sure they are checked off before
								the time of departure. Once the events are set notifications will be sent before 
								the event at times set by the user or default times in the app, once the last
								reminder is sent it will ask the user to check off the list of items for the event 
								or cancel the event. Most of the events set in the app would be fixed weekly such
								as timetabled events for school, work or parents to do list for their children.
								The application would be designed mostly for smart phones and would have three
								main sections, first being the ‘Upcoming event’ section which would include all
								the upcoming events for the next week or month, this would give the user quick
								access to all the important events that are soon. The next section is the ‘Calendar’ 
								section that would have all the events that are planned on a monthly calendar and the
								user would be able to click on any of the events and check the details of the event.
								The third section would just be a complete list of all the events set, recent events
								and past events. The user would be able to add events through the calendar or by an
								icon that will be on the main layout of the application. The user can also setup a 
								bonus function that would keep track of where their popular items are in their room
								or house, this feature would be paired with lights or a beeper on their draws or
								wardrobe that would be turned on when the user enters the checklist phase for their event.</p>
								
								<p>The software is the main piece of the project and would need to be coded by a programming
								language that is compatible with mobile application development this does include some of
								the more popularly used ones such as java, C++ and python. This software would have to be
								built on a mobile app building platform such as Appery.io or BuildFire. For the lights and
								beepers there would have to be raspberry pi use to make them pair with the application.</p>
								
								<p>The skills required for the project would include programming knowledge with a compatible
								programming language and knowledge of mobile application development especially how to use
								mobile app building platforms. There is going to be a need for knowledge of raspberry pi 
								and how to use it in adjacent to the mobile application. It should be easy to find the programming
								skills for the project as the code shouldn’t be too complicated and shouldn’t require expert
								use of a programming language. The skills for the building platform for the mobile application
								might be harder to find as it is a more unique skill but should be feasible to acquire or learn
								the skills. The hardware section of the project would be difficult as raspberry pi isn’t free
								and would require knowledge of information systems.</p>
								
								<p>If this project would work as planned it would allow users to be more relaxed when it comes
								to quick exits from home and would bring certainty to their minds that they are fully prepared
								for their day or trip. It would provide a organised system to forgetful users including aspiring
								school kids, rushed business people or stressed University students.  </p>

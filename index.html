									<h2>Intrest in IT</h2>
								</header>
								<ul class="features">
								<p>At first my interest in IT was being apart of a game development team coming up with designs
								and improvements to games, but now I’m just interested in being apart of a software development
								team and I like all aspects of the process such as designing, development or evaluating or updating.
								My interest in IT started when I first started to find conversations online discussing their opinions
								on video games and how they could be improved, so I chose IT electives in high school and that
								broadened my view on the options for employment and a range of expertise you can have.
								They main reason I was influenced to do project base work was by a student teacher at
								my high school who was a consultant for government agencies developing systems and interfaces for them.</p>
								
								<p>I chose to come to RMIT because all my IT classmates in high school agreed that RMIT was the
								best choice for learning more IT skills and is more respected by employers and has a good reputation.</p>
								
								<p>I expect to learn how to program at more experienced levels as well as broaden my skills in 
								different sections of IT, so I have a variety of experience and a collective understanding of the IT world.</p>
